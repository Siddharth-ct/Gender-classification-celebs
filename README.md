The model was trained for 10 epochs. The model performance is acceptable and  With a bit more of models layers, dropouts, batch normalization, increasing the number of filters etc and training the model for 30 to 40 epochs or more will result in even better accuracy.

## The following plots and charts were made to understand the model beter.
